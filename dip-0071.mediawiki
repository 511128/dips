==Abstract==

This DIP defines a MIME (RFC 2046) Media Type for Dogecoin payment
protocol message files. These vary slightly from the MIME types
defined in BIP0070, in that they use the "x-dogecoin" prefix for
the subtype.

==Specification==

The MIME type used for Dogecoin payment protocol messages are:

{|
| Message || Type/Subtype
|-
| PaymentRequest || application/x-dogecoin-paymentrequest
|-
| Payment || application/x-dogecoin-payment
|-
| PaymentACK || application/x-dogecoin-paymentack
|}

Note: Implementations MAY choose to accept MIME types as follows,
in addition to the MIME types listed above. These MIME types SHOULD NOT
be used when creating files, however, as the MIME types are not
currently registered:

{|
| Message || Type/Subtype
|-
| PaymentRequest || application/dogecoin-paymentrequest
|-
| Payment || application/dogecoin-payment
|-
| PaymentACK || application/dogecoin-paymentack
|}
