==Abstract==

This DIP describes changes to BIP0070 to adapt it to be suitable for use with Dogecoin Core.
Decisions made in BIP0070 are Bitcoin-specific, and minor changes are required to ensure no
accidental cross-over between the two specifications. This specification should be read
in combination with DIP0071.

===PaymentDetails/PaymentRequest===

Where network names in BIP0070 are "main" and "test", for Dogecoin the network names
"doge-main" and "doge-test" are to be used instead. The name of the coin is included
in the network names in order to ensure there is no risk of further complication from
any coins further forking this specification.
